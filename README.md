This project was very challenging but I am excited that I was able to push through. I learned a ton and I also understand that experience is invaluable. I failed a lot and repeatedly walked off but the finished product I am proud of.

The hardest thing for me was definitely the scroll feature. It is still not functioning correctly but I am confident that I can get it working with more time. Another thing I struggled with was the overall css. The boxes took me for a whirl but I was able to manage.

The easy part was the background of course and it was fun. Also the functions was fun. It will always feel good to see something come to life essentially.

The new skills that I learned was how to essentially implement the keyframe and animations. While im no expert. I know with a lot of practice, I will be a strong skill.
